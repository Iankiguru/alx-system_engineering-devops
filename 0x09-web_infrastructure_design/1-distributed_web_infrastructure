Components and Their Roles
Load Balancer (HAproxy):
Why: To distribute incoming web traffic across multiple servers to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed.

Distribution Algorithm: Round Robin. It cycles through the servers in order, distributing each new connection to the next server in the list.
Active-Active vs Active-Passive: Configured for an Active-Active setup where all servers are used to service requests.

Web Server (Nginx):
Why: To serve static files and proxy requests that require dynamic processing to the application server.

Application Server:
Why: To process dynamic content, business logic, and interact with the database.

Application Files (Code Base):
Why: Houses the website's code, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side scripts.

Database (MySQL):
Why: To store, retrieve, and manage data.
Primary-Replica Cluster: There is a Primary (Master) and one or more Replica (Slave) nodes. The Primary handles all writes, while reads can be offloaded to Replicas.
Specifics

Distribution Algorithm:
Round Robin: It's simple and doesn't require knowledge about the current load on each server.
Active-Active vs Active-Passive:
Active-Active: All servers are active and share the load equally.
Active-Passive: One server is active while others are on standby.
Database Primary-Replica Cluster:
Primary (Master): Handles write operations.
Replica (Slave): Handles read operations.

Issues
SPOF (Single Points of Failure):
1.Load Balancer: If it fails, the entire system is inaccessible.
2.Database: If the Primary node fails, writes can't be performed.

Security Issues:
1.No Firewall: Exposed to various attacks.
2.No HTTPS: Data is transferred in plaintext.

No Monitoring:
1.Cannot identify system performance issues or failures in real-time.
