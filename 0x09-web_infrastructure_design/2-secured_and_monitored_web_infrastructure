Secure and Monitored Three-Server Web Infrastructure Design for www.foobar.com

Components and Their Roles
Firewalls (x3):
What Firewalls Are For: They act as a barrier between your internal network and incoming traffic from external sources.
Why: To block unauthorized access and only allow permitted traffic.

SSL Certificate:
Why: To encrypt data that is being sent over the network.
Why HTTPS: It ensures that the data between the user and the server is encrypted and cannot be easily intercepted.

Monitoring Clients (x3):
Why: To collect data and metrics for system monitoring.
What Monitoring Is Used For: To track the performance, errors, and other important metrics.

Data Collection: These clients collect data like CPU usage, memory, QPS (Queries Per Second), and send it to a centralized monitoring service like Sumo Logic.

Specifics
Monitoring Web Server QPS:
Configure your monitoring client to specifically track the QPS metric on the web server. This usually involves setting a rule or query in your monitoring solution to collect and report this metric.

Issues
1.SSL Termination at Load Balancer:
Why an Issue: If SSL is terminated at the load balancer, then traffic between the load balancer and internal servers is not encrypted, posing a security risk.

2.Single MySQL Server for Writes:
Why an Issue: If this server fails, the application will not be able to perform any write operations, leading to service disruption.

3.Same Components on All Servers:
Why an Issue: This does not allow for specialized optimization and poses a risk if a common vulnerability is discovered in one of the components.
