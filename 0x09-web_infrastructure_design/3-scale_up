Split Components with HAproxy Cluster for Web Infrastructure.

Components and Their Roles
1.Additional Load Balancer (HAproxy):
Why: To create a load balancer cluster for high availability and fault tolerance.
2.Split Components:
-Web Server: To serve static files and handle initial user requests.
-Application Server: To process dynamic content and business logic.
-Database Server: To store and manage application data.

Specifics
1.Load Balancer Cluster (HAproxy):
-Load Balancer 1 and Load Balancer 2 are configured as a cluster to share the load and provide redundancy.
-Why Cluster: To ensure that if one load balancer fails, the other can take over, minimizing downtime.
2.Split Components:
-Why: To allow each server to specialize in its role, making it easier to scale and optimize each component independently.
