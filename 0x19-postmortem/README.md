**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident**

*Issue Summary:*

- **Duration of the Outage:** The outage occurred from 2:30 PM to 5:45 PM (UTC-5) on November 15th, 20XX.

- **Impact:** The outage affected our primary web service, resulting in intermittent downtime and slow performance for users. Approximately 25% of our users experienced disruptions, leading to frustration and potential loss of business.

- **Root Cause:** The root cause of the issue was a database query bottleneck that led to increased response times and occasional service unavailability.

*Timeline:*

- **Issue Detection:** The issue was initially detected when the monitoring system triggered an alert due to a significant increase in response times and a spike in error rates. Several users also reported slow page loading times.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - The operations team started investigating the issue immediately, suspecting database-related problems.
  - The engineering team began analyzing the database query logs to identify performance bottlenecks.
  - Misleading paths: Initially, there were suspicions of a DDoS attack and network issues, which were quickly ruled out after network analysis.
  - The incident was escalated to the senior database administrator and the lead software engineer after initial investigations.

- **Resolution:** After a thorough examination of the database query logs, it was discovered that a specific type of query, frequently executed during peak traffic, was inefficient and causing contention. The issue was addressed by optimizing the database queries and deploying the changes to the production environment.

*Root Cause and Resolution:*

- **Root Cause:** The root cause of the issue was a database query bottleneck. A particular type of query was not efficiently indexed, leading to a significant increase in execution time. This query was frequently executed, causing a backlog and slowing down the database's overall performance.

- **Resolution:** To address the issue, the engineering team:
  - Modified the query to optimize its performance.
  - Added appropriate indexing to the database tables.
  - Tested the changes in a staging environment to ensure no regressions.
  - Deployed the optimized code and database schema to the production environment during a scheduled maintenance window.
  - Monitored the system closely after the update to confirm the issue was fully resolved.

*Corrective and Preventative Measures:*

- **To Improve/Fix:**
  - Enhance database query performance monitoring to detect similar issues proactively.
  - Implement automated alerting for query performance degradation.
  - Conduct regular performance audits to identify and address potential bottlenecks.

- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Create a playbook for handling similar incidents in the future, including clear steps for diagnosing and addressing database-related problems.
  - Implement database query optimization guidelines and training for developers to prevent future occurrences.
  - Establish better communication channels for rapid incident escalation and resolution, involving relevant teams.
  - Schedule periodic load testing to identify and mitigate performance issues before they impact users.

This postmortem serves as a valuable learning experience for our team. We have identified the root cause, resolved the issue, and outlined a plan for preventing similar incidents in the future. We are committed to improving our infrastructure and processes to ensure a more reliable and responsive user experience.
